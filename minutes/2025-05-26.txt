Michael presented Ch10: Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Generics were covered quickly.
Traits were compared to Java's interfaces, and the few differences were discussed.
The main discussion was on lifetimes:
- This is a hint to the borrow checker, adding restrictions to make the job easier
- Many lifetimes are handled automatically.

This was the final meeting of the reading group:
- Main language features have now been covered
- Rust isn't the immediate focus for the programmable spaces group this summer
- Other features are better covered individually when encountered in practice
- We'll keep the Teams chat open for future conversations

A self-congratulatory round of applause was given
