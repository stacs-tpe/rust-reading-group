### Variations

<b>Tuple structs</b> - values with unnamed attributes (eg we would probally use when value meaning is implied through index). ```struct Color(i32, i32, i32);``` (RGB). Accessed through ```.index``` notation
<i>Any thoughts on other examples where we may use?</i>

<b>Unit-like structs</b> - A struct without attributes (unit). We will learn more on why we may want this when discussing traits ! This will be equal to every other type ðŸ¤¯
